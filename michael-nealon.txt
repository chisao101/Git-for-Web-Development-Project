Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        inline elements width is defined by content around it
        block elements width is defined by the document
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        The element is positionedrelative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. If no positioned ancestor exists, it uses the document body. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        display: inline-block;
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Block: 
            h1, h2, h3, etc
            div
            section
        Inline:
            span 
            a 
        Inline-Block:

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
        The box model is the box that exists around each element. It contains margins, padding, borders, and content.
        The "fix" is a css reset:
        *{
            margin:0;
            padding:0;
            box-sizing:border-box;
        }
        This sets all margins and padding to 0 so the box model will only use the box styles you define.
